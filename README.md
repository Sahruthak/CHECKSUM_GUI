# CHECKSUM_GUI
The Checksum GUI is a graphical user interface (GUI) tool that assists users in generating and verifying checksums for files. A checksum is a value derived from a digital file using an algorithm. It acts as a unique identifier for the file, allowing users to verify its integrity and detect any modifications or errors.
The Checksum GUI simplifies the process of working with checksums by providing an intuitive and user-friendly interface. Here is a possible description of the Checksum GUI's features and functionality:
File Selection: The GUI allows users to select one or multiple files for which they want to generate or verify checksums. This can be done through a file browser or by dragging and dropping files into the GUI.
Algorithm Selection: Users can choose from a variety of commonly used checksum algorithms, such as MD5, SHA-1, SHA-256, or CRC32. The GUI provides a selection of algorithms to suit different security and compatibility requirements.
Checksum Generation: With a simple click of a button, the GUI calculates the checksum for the selected file(s) using the chosen algorithm. The generated checksum is displayed on the interface, making it easy for users to copy and share if needed.
Checksum Verification: Users can also verify the integrity of files by comparing the generated checksum with an expected checksum. The GUI provides an input field for users to enter the expected checksum, and it quickly performs the comparison to determine if the file(s) have been modified or corrupted.
Batch Processing: The Checksum GUI supports batch processing, enabling users to generate or verify checksums for multiple files at once. This is particularly useful when dealing with a large number of files or when performing routine integrity checks.
User Notifications: The GUI provides clear and concise notifications or status messages to keep users informed about the progress and results of checksum generation or verification. This helps users quickly identify any issues or discrepancies.
Overall, the Checksum GUI simplifies the process of generating and verifying checksums, providing users with a convenient and efficient way to ensure the integrity and authenticity of their files.
